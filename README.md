# Jacob Knyspel

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a PhD student at the [SGDP Centre](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sgdp), King's College London, funded by the [KCL MRC DTP](https://kcl-mrcdtp.com/). My area of research is the genetics of common mental health problems. Iâ€™m especially interested in improving causal inference and phenotypic specificity in genetics research using methods such as graphical modelling and structural equation modelling.
